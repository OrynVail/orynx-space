I sink into my bed; nothing holds—
a patient etherised upon the mattress,
spilled from my skull into the dark.
Language leaks from the sockets.
The abyss chews without sound.

The quilt is a tide of ash and feathers,
a dead bird’s wing across my chest.
Memories curdle at the edge of breath,
thin soup in a hospital tray.
Gravity claws what my hands can’t keep.

The ceiling hangs where the sky should be,
its beams black with old smoke.
Fingers trace a seam that isn’t there—
the stitch between body and ghost,
between waking and whatever redeems.

I am anchor and the falling stone,
coughing dust, swallowing echoes.
The hush of the tide, the pull of the deep—
currents whisper names that rot in my teeth.

A pause between pulses, a breath that stutters,
folded in absence, untouched by embrace.
The weight is a lullaby sung by machines
in a ward of the sleepless.
Even silence has wires here.

In this space between drowning and dream
I find no comfort, only the falling.
Between breath and surrender, between weight and release
I sink like a knife into buttered earth.

I sink and sink until darkness comes,
the only language my soul remembers,
not light but the smell of scorched feathers.
Nothing holds me in this endless sum.
I am — _embers in the sun._
