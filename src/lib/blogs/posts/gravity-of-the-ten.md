# Ever wonder why billionaires feel like black holes?

> *If the ten richest people lost **99.999%** of their wealth, they would still outweigh **99%** of the planet.*

That is not prosperity. That is a *force* that warps everything around it.

Wealth at that scale does not sit idle. It bends orbits. It warps futures. It pulls the fabric of civilization into its shadow, creating zones where human potential itself cannot escape.

## **The Information Problem**

Information, like light, needs energy to exist in the world. And energy costs money. The equations for fusion exist, but building reactors like ITER demands $20 billion in overruns alone. This isn't abstract: promising malaria vaccines languish in underfunded labs, where global R&D scrapes by on $500 million annually against a needed $2 billion for real breakthroughs.

CRISPR could eliminate genetic diseases, but trials for therapies like Casgevy cost $1-2 million per patient, sums that dwarf entire national budgets. The true crime: wealth concentration starves these efforts, forming vast deserts where knowledge forms but never materializes.

The ten richest control roughly **$1.5 trillion** — enough to fund global university R&D for nearly a decade. Instead, it pools in portfolios while brilliance fades unnamed. This isn't just hoarding; it's a barrier that traps innovation in survival mode.

## **The Escape Velocity**

Science doesn't bloom in poverty. It blooms where basic needs free minds for wonder. Yet billions lack power, water, _a chance_. Survival eclipses curiosity: the next Newton drives a taxi in a village without power, or a potential Ramanujan in rural India dies at 32 from tuberculosis exasperated by malnutrition, his self-taught genius barely glimpsed.

This mirrors physics: beyond extreme wealth concentration, knowledge hits an event horizon, formed but pulled back into basic needs. Europe's colonial wealth sparked the Scientific Revolution. America's postwar boom launched the space program. China's surging GDP now builds massive particle accelerators, like the planned 100km CEPC, while much of the world observes from afar.

Progress chases capital, and innovation hubs relocate with it, dragging the *'garages'* of invention along. Yesterday's breakthroughs came from Europe's merchant cities; Today's from U.S. tech valleys fuelled by historical prosperity. Tomorrow's? Likely China's megacities, as wealth shifts east. But for billions in the global South, those garages remain distant dreams, inaccessible without bridging the resource chasm.

## **Inequality as Incentive?**

Sure, inequality can spark risks, think Schumpeter's *"creative destruction"*, where billionaires fund moonshots. Elon Musk's SpaceX, backed by his fortune and public subsidies, pushes humanity toward Mars. Private capital birthed iPhones from garages, accelerating tech leaps.

But those garages thrive in wealth-rich ecosystems, not vacuums. SpaceX advances a vision tied to one man and his adopted nation, creating a capitalist monopoly in orbit rather than collective progress. And for talent from resource-starved places? The path is blocked — visas, education, networks favour the already-privileged. Inequality incentivizes, yes, but skews toward private whims over shared needs, leaving public labs in the dust.

## **The Warping**

This force doesn't just distort markets; it alters the map of possibility itself. It dictates which diseases stay incurable, which planets unreachable, which equations unsolved. Not because answers elude us, but because resources collapse into ten accounts.

Every hoarded billion means another undiscovered talent lost, a generation's worth. Hoarding warps not just economies, but our shared trajectory.

## The Verdict

The ten don’t just own fortunes. They own the curvature of human possibility. The longer this mass concentrates, the more our brightest futures orbit endlessly, unreachable. This isn’t inequality. This isn’t even economics.
