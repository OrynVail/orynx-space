### _In Defense of What Was Never Absent_

Darkness does not arrive. It does not spread, creep, or conquer.

It simply **is**. Always has been.

We speak of light as though it were the baseline of existence, a divine flicker from which life emerges. But that is a lie we inherited from fire-worshippers and physicists alike. Light is not the constant.

**Darkness is.**

It was here before photons learned to play. It remains after the last star forgets its name. And in between, it watches quietly while we scramble for meaning in the glow.

Darkness is not black, or soft, or still. Those are names we gave it, and names arrive late. It's what exists before *existence* becomes measurable. It is the impossibility of removal having meaning. It does not reflect, does not declare, does not announce its presence. It is presence without the need for announcement.

## **The Unnamed Before Names**

When I try to explain darkness to someone who's never seen light, I realize how backwards we've always been.

Why explain *absence* through the lens of *presence*? Why define the void through phenomena that temporarily disrupt it? That’s like defining silence through noise. Or trying to grasp the void by pointing to what isn’t there.

The void is not the absence of things. It is the absence of *absence itself*, the ground beneath any conceptual structure we attempt to build, the failure point of dualities.

To one who has never seen, darkness is not a *thing*. It is not a color, or a space. It is the **default condition** of being.

Like silence before music.  
Like stillness before breath.  
Like the unnamed before names were born.

Scripture says: 
> *"And then there was Light."*

That single line betrays the truth. It had to be **introduced**. Darkness was not declared. It didn't need to be.

It was already there.

## **Beyond Measurement**

A scientist might say darkness is merely the absence of photons.

But I disagree.

That is a definition built on measurement. Not meaning.

To me, darkness is the **bedrock of perception**, the blank field where thought first stirs. We see it not with our eyes, but with our memory of being unborn.

It is not sinister. It is not evil. Those are projections.

What it truly is—  
is **freedom**.

Not spatial. Not temporal. It is a conceptual vanishing point where even opposition fails. It is neither empty nor full. Its the moment where language breaks its own spine. The void is where before and after collapse.

No glare.  
No witness.  
No need to explain.

## **The Return**

We came from it.  
We return to it.

And all our moments of clarity are just temporary piercings of this permanent state.

It is not death. It is not sleep.  
It is what lies beneath even those.

The void doesn't need our permission to exist. It doesn't ask to be understood.

But if you sit still long enough, it might just let you remember what you were **before you had a name.**

> This is not about darkness as metaphor. This is about recognizing the ground of being itself. The unchanging constant that makes all change possible.

This is not an aesthetic posture or poetic drama. It is a reckoning. This is a return to the **limit** of what can be spoken. 

The light will fade. The stars will die. The universe will expand into cold silence.

But darkness?

Darkness was never born.  
And it will never die.

It simply **is**.
